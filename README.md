Introduction
============

This is a tool to easily generate ID cards for printing out and laminating. Created first for use at the Fastaval roleplaying convention and since generalized and open-sourced.

The basic idea is to allow for easy creation of ID cards using several different templates, setting name, function and extra info for each card plus embedding photos and extra images. After processing the cards can be downloaded as PDF and printed directly

Installing
==========
You'll need apache, nginx or some other web-server capable of doing php.

The documentroot should be the root of the folder. The output, cache and config folders should be writable by php but nothing else needs to be writable so set your permissions accordingly.

Things should more or less work out of the box. Go to /settings.php to set up the different variables needed and to upload background templates.
