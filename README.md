Introduction
============

This is a tool to easily generate ID cards for printing out
and laminating. Created first for use at the Fastaval
roleplaying convention and since generalized and open-sourced.

The basic idea is to allow for easy creation of ID cards
using several different templates, setting name, function and
extra info for each card plus embedding photos and extra
images. After processing the cards can be downloaded as PDF
and printed directly
